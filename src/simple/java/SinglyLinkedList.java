//A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be 
//traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked 
//list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps 
//in maintaining the structure of the list. a singly linked list node contains two fields one is 
//address of next node and second one is data assigned to the present node
//unlike arraylist a LinkedList is a data structure that stores elements in a non-contiguous 
//location. It is a linear data structure.
